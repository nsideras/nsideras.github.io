   <h1>
Text Based Charts with Mermaid.JS
</h1>
      <p>Mermaid is a charting a diagram and charting tool that I’ve been using on projects this year. It’s effectively a Markdown add-in library which means it generates diagrams based on simple text files. This has been very powerful for me because I often get tripped up in the context-switching that it takes to document a back-end system: building out API calls in Visual Studio or Postman, reviewing responses against sample data, making adjustments to the call, then writing up the details, etc. With Mermaid I also don’t have to remember how to build out specific sections and can instead focus on a simpler grammar – instead of dragging around little lines and arrows I can rapidly type out a chart as I’m working.</p>
